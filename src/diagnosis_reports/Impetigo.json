        "In serious cases, the infection invades a deeper layer of skin and turns into a form of impetigo called ecthyma.When that happens, your child gets pus - filled bumps with a crust that 's much darker and thicker than ordinary impetigo.",

        "Ecthyma can be very itchy.If your child scratches the irritated area, it can cause the infection to spread quickly.If you don 't get it treated, the sores may cause permanent scars and changes in skin color."
